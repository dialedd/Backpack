(incomplete)

Just a regular backpacks system, some features include:
- upgradable
- nbt as the storage method
- many dupe preventives

To get a backpack just do /backpack <integer>
integer represents the amount of rows you want

to upgrade the backpack just do /upgrade
I started working on a custom upgrading animation with an anvil but never finished

Hope you like it
